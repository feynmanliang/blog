As an administrator managing multiple Kubernetes clusters, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of your configurations is paramount. Mistakes in YAML files, even minor ones, can have catastrophic effects on your infrastructure and business continuity. This blog post explores how leveraging advanced YAML editing tools can significantly enhance your workflow, providing safety checks and autocompletion to help you configure your clusters more rapidly and with greater confidence.

## User Story

As an administrator of multiple Kubernetes clusters, my tools for editing YAML should leverage knowledge of YAML syntax and schemas to provide additional safety checks and autocompletion so that I can configure my cluster more rapidly and confidently.

## Solution: Integrating YAML Language Server

To address these needs, we propose integrating the YAML language server ([yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server)) into your development environment. This tool, coupled with Kubernetes and Flux configurations, enhances the editing experience by ensuring syntax correctness and schema compliance.

### Background

#### Kubernetes: A Unified Infrastructure API

Kubernetes abstracts infrastructure management across various clouds and on-premises environments, providing a uniform API. This abstraction simplifies the deployment and management of applications at scale.

#### Flux: GitOps for Kubernetes

Flux ([fluxcd.io](https://fluxcd.io/)) revolutionizes Kubernetes management with GitOps practices. It enables declarative management of your Kubernetes infrastructure, allowing you to deploy directly from a Git repository. This approach ensures consistency and simplifies the deployment pipeline.

## Detailed Description

### Setting Up the YAML Language Server

1. **Install the YAML Language Server**

   Begin by installing the [YAML language server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server) in your development environment. Since I am currently using [NvChad](https://nvchad.com), I first configure [mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) to ensure the language server is installed by adding the following to `lua/plugins/init.lua`:

   ```lua 
   {
     "williamboman/mason.nvim",
     opts = {
       ensure_installed = {
        ...
        "yaml-language-server",
       },
     },
   },
   ```

2. **Configure the Editor**

   Enable the LSP (Language Server Protocol) for Kubernetes in your editor. This setup will provide features like syntax validation, schema validation, and autocompletion.

   For Neovim users, we can configure [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/) to use the language server by adding the following to `lua/configs/lspconfig.lua`:

   ```lua 
   lspconfig.yamlls.setup {
     settings = {
       yaml = {
         schemas = {
           kubernetes = "/*.yaml"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   The `yaml.schemas.kubernetes` setting sets a [schema association](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server?tab=readme-ov-file#using-yamlschemas-settings) to try and parse YAML files with Kubernetes schemas.


### Example: Testing Validation of a ConfigMap

To illustrate the benefits, let’s walk through an example of validating a ConfigMap:

- **Step 1: Create a Sample ConfigMap YAML File**

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: example-config
  data:
    key: value
  ```

- **Step 2: Enable LSP and Validate**

  With the YAML language server configured, your editor will highlight syntax errors and schema violations. This feature ensures that your ConfigMap adheres to the correct structure and data types.

<div transform-images="avif webp jpg 600@2" style="text-align: center;">
    <img alt="ConfigMap Validation Screenshot" src="/img/flux-k8s-yaml-ls/configmap_validation.png" />
</div>

### Inline Schemas for Flux

Flux configurations can also benefit from inline schemas. Let’s look at how you can validate a Flux Kustomization fileusing an inline schema association:

  ```yaml
    # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datreeio/CRDs-catalog/main/kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/kustomization_v1.json
    apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
    kind: Kustomization
    metadata:
      name: example
    spec:
      key: value
  ```

  The YAML language server will now validate the Kustomization file against the specified schema, ensuring that all resources are correctly defined.

<div transform-images="avif webp jpg 600@2" style="text-align: center;">
    <img alt="Flux Kustomization Validation Screenshot" src="/img/flux-k8s-yaml-ls/flux-kustomization-valid.png" />
</div>

### Schema-Aware Autocomplete

One of the standout features of the YAML language server is its schema-aware autocomplete functionality. This feature significantly speeds up the configuration process by suggesting valid options based on the schema.

- **Example Usage**

  As you type, the editor will provide suggestions that are contextually relevant, reducing the chance of errors and enhancing productivity.

<div transform-images="avif webp jpg 600@2" style="text-align: center;">
    <img alt="Autocomplete Screenshot" src="/img/flux-k8s-yaml-ls/autocomplete.png" />
</div>

## Conclusion

In environments where even a small change in configuration can disrupt service for all customers, intelligent safety checks become indispensable. The YAML language server not only validates syntax but also ensures schema conformance, catching errors before they are deployed. 

By leveraging the LSP abstraction, any supported editor can benefit from these features, making your Kubernetes configuration process safer, faster, and more reliable. Embracing these tools can be a game-changer, allowing administrators to manage complex Kubernetes environments with ease and confidence.
