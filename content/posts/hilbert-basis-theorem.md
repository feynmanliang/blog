Let $k$ be a field. Then ideal $I \subset k[x]$ is finitely generated.

A ring $R$ is Noetherian if every ideal $I \subset R$ is finitely generated.
Equivalently, $R$ is Noetherian if every ascending chain of ideals
$$I_1 \subset I_2 \subset I_3 \subset \cdots$$
eventually terminates (there exists an $n$ such that $I\_n = I\_{n+1} = I\_{n+2} = \cdots$).

If $R$ is Noetherian, then $R[x]$ is Noetherian.

Any field $k$ is Noetherian.
